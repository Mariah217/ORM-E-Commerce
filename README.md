## Installation

To begin using this application, you will need to install several different libraries: express, dotenv, mysql2 and sequelize along with a serparate application called Insomnia . To install these, you will need to open your terminal and type in npm i *insert name of library here* and press enter. Once the libraries have been installed, you will need to open a separate terminal and login to mysql to run the schema file. After that, open another terminal and type npm run seed and finally npm start, and the server will then be connected and ready to go. Once the server is live, you will need to open insomnia to perform the CRUD operations for the create, read, update and delete.
